### Project Details

**Abstract.** Social insight can help ascertain future market conditions for crypto, making it possible to simplify trading and invest smarter. Social metrics provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if the average crypto user is unable to distil these metrics into bitesize, digestible data.

We propose a solution powered by AI-driven real-time data, backed by social insights and metrics to determine when to buy (opt-in) or sell (opt-out) in the crypto market with ease.

#### Problem and Solution

#### 1. Introduction

The major problem with crypto is its uncertainty about the future, making it a volatile asset because of how much and how quickly its value can change unexpectedly. While the best indicator of the future is the past, for crypto, there isn't much historical past to look at and give us an idea of how stable things will or won't be in the future. However, social insights from millions of conversations happening across social for crypto can create trends, which form patterns that can be studied and analyzed to determine and checkmate volatility in the crypto market.

Our solution is the Proton Crypto Index designed to combine and simplify technical and social analysis, to level the playing field for the average crypto investor.
